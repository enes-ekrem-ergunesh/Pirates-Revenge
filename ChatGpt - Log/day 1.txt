I want to make a game, 2d platform game, scene is changing when player walk through the endpoint of the current scene. There are some challenges as in mario game, in some scenes there are chests, when player open that chest, she needs to solve a puzzle to get some materials. In the end of each scenario, player finds a hacksmith that she can upgrade her character. The main story of the game could be a pirate trying to get revenge of his enemy that betrayed him, that took his glass eye, the eye would be misery to the player until the end of the game.
Sounds like you have a good idea for a game! Here are some steps you can take to start developing your 2D platformer:

Plan out your game's overall structure and gameplay mechanics. This includes deciding on the number of levels and what challenges and puzzles the player will face in each level. You should also determine what upgrades and abilities the player will have at their disposal and how they can be obtained.

Create a storyboard or flowchart to outline the progression of the game. This can help you visualize the player's journey and ensure that the gameplay and story elements fit together well.

Design and create the artwork for your game. This includes creating sprites for the player character, enemies, and other in-game assets such as backgrounds, platforms, and items. You can use a tool like Adobe Photoshop or a pixel art software like Aseprite to create your artwork.

Implement the gameplay mechanics and level design. You can use a game engine like Unity or GameMaker Studio to create your game. These tools provide a range of features that can help you create your levels, including tools for designing platforms, setting up enemy AI, and implementing player controls.

Test and debug your game to iron out any issues and ensure that it is enjoyable and challenging for players. You can enlist the help of friends or other members of the game development community to playtest your game and provide feedback.

Once you have a completed game, you can then consider publishing it on platforms like Steam or the App Store. This will involve creating marketing materials, setting up a website for your game, and preparing any necessary documentation.

I hope this helps get you started on your 2D platformer! Let me know if you have any other questions.

I need to fill a form as a plan so, what is the target audience for this game
Determining the target audience for your game is an important step in the planning process. This will help you focus your development efforts and ensure that your game is tailored to the needs and interests of your intended players.

When considering the target audience for your 2D platformer, you should consider factors such as age, gender, interests, and skill level. For example, if your game is intended for children, you may want to make the gameplay more straightforward and the challenges less difficult, while if your game is intended for more experienced gamers, you may want to include more complex puzzles and obstacles.

In terms of the specific target audience for your game, it sounds like it could be appealing to a wide range of players, including fans of action games, puzzle games, and adventure games. The theme of a pirate seeking revenge could also appeal to players who enjoy historical or fictional tales of pirates and treasure.
